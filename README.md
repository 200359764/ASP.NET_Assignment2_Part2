<p>This site is beilt in COMP2084 for Assignment2 Part 1 using ASP.NET, SQL Server, Entity Framework, and Microsoft Azure and Moq</p>

I tried to connect with microsoft azure, and it said "Your subscription or app is disabled". I don't know what happen on here and I think I need to pay money to use azure. This should be free because I'm using azure for student but I don't know why it doesn't work. I'm so sorry about that.
